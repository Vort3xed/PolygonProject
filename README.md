# PolygonProject
Calculate the area of any irregular polygon

Branch main is only for base code! Updated code is found in master.

Slow updates, DM me on discord if you have any suggestions or bugs to report. 

And yes, I don't need you to tell me, the whole program is in **one class file**. This will hopefully, change soon.

Plans/future objectives (in order of importance)
1. Create a reset function
2. Split the code into multiple files
3. Improve readability
4. ~~Create a plot point counter~~
5. Switch to CSS for node styling?
6. Simplify code
7. Make the code not hard coded
